# Occluded_Object_Detection_for_AVs

This repository contains the code of occluded object detection using the Yolov5 model on a novel dataset prepared by us.

Here is a link to the eventual paper published in IEEE on an updated code and dataset: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9946565
